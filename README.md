## Course Overview
In this course, I've been learning about various cybersecurity tools and techniques, with a focus on practical applications. The coursework has covered a wide range of topics, including but not limited to web penetration testing, systems hacking, and the usage of popular tools such as Nmap, Wireshark, Burp Suite, Mimikatz, and many more.

## Weekly Assignments Overview:
### Week 1: Web Penetration Testing
During the first week, we delved into the exciting world of web penetration testing. We explored the OWASP Top Ten, a list of the ten most critical web application security risks. Here are the OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities:

- Broken Access Control
- Cryptographic Failures
- Injection
- Insecure Design
- Security Misconfiguration
- Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- Identification and Authentication Failures
- Software and Data Integrity Failures
- Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
- Server-Side Request Forgery

For the assignment, I thoroughly investigated one CWE from each of these vulnerabilities, showcasing practical scenarios and countermeasures.

### Week 2: Systems Hacking with Kali Linux
In the second week of the course, we dived into systems hacking using the powerful Kali Linux distribution. The curriculum covered a wide array of topics, including:

- Information Gathering
- Vulnerability Analysis
- Web Application Analysis
- Database Assessment
- Password Attacks
- Wireless Attacks
- Reverse Engineering
- Exploitation Tools
- Sniffing Spoofing
- Post Exploitation

For the assignment, I delved into one tool from each category, demonstrating their usage and providing insights into how they can be employed for various security assessments and penetration testing tasks.
